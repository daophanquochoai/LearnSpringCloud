<h2>What are Microservices?</h2>
<p>Microservices is an architectural style where applications are broken down into smaller, independent services, each responsible for performing a specific business function. These services can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently, allowing for easier scaling, improved fault isolation, and faster development cycles. Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, where all functionalities are tightly coupled, Microservices architecture promotes loose coupling, enabling better manageability and continuous delivery.</p>
